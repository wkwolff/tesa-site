# Welcome to TESA

We are thrilled to announce the official launch of **The Engineering and Science Academy (TESA)** website! This marks an exciting milestone in our mission to transform aerospace education for students in grades 6-12.

## Our Mission

TESA was founded to address a critical challenge in STEM education: the 60% attrition rate among first-year engineering students. We believe that with the right preparation, mentorship, and hands-on experience, every student can thrive in rigorous STEM programs.

Through our **10-week for-credit courses**, students:

- Tackle real-world design challenges
- Earn industry-recognized certifications
- Develop the confidence to succeed in college engineering programs

## What Makes TESA Different

### Hands-On Learning

Our curriculum isn't just theoretical - students work on actual aerospace projects, learning the same tools used by professionals in the industry:

1. **MATLAB** - The industry standard for technical computing
2. **Ansys STK** - Satellite toolkit used by space agencies worldwide
3. **PMI CAPM** - Project management certification recognized globally

### Expert Mentorship

Founded by Lt. Commander Diallo Wallace, a **Space Camp Hall of Fame 2025** inductee and Naval Academy aerospace engineering professor, TESA brings real-world aerospace experience directly to students.

### Pathway to Success

Our comprehensive curriculum spans grades 6-12, covering:

- **Science**: Physics, Statics, Dynamics
- **Technology**: MATLAB, Raspberry Pi, Arduino
- **Engineering**: Aerospace, Mechanical, Electrical, Structural
- **Mathematics**: Calculus, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra

## Looking Ahead

As we prepare for our January 2026 legislative meetings, we're excited to share our vision for aerospace education with policymakers, educators, and families across Maryland and beyond.

Our roadmap includes:

- Expanding from Maryland airports to national reach
- Partnering with DODEA to serve military families
- Continuing to build industry partnerships

## Get Involved

Whether you're a:

- **Parent** looking for rigorous STEM education for your child
- **Funder** interested in supporting aerospace education
- **Student** ready to explore the final frontier

We invite you to explore our programs and join us on this journey.
